# Bryan Grimes (Bearded Giant)

Principal Engineer & Architect at [Recharge](https://github.com/RechargePayments) · Owner of [Bearded Giant LLC](https://beardedgiant.ai)  
Based in Philadelphia, PA

### The Philosophy

I have been building backend systems for 25+ years. My professional work (Distributed Systems, Auth, Scale) happens in private repositories.

My public GitHub is my workbench. It is where I build the tooling, frameworks, and automation that allow me to manage that complexity. I focus heavily on **Developer Experience**—if a workflow has friction, I script it away.

### The Workflow Engine

These are the repositories that actually power my day-to-day. They aren't always polished products; they are the raw tools I use to maintain velocity.

| Repo | Category | The Role it Plays |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**script-hodge-podge**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/script-hodge-podge) | Automation | **The Glue.** A collection of critical workflow scripts—specifically for managing Git Worktree lifecycles and project workspace isolation. |
| [**claude-code-config**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/claude-code-config) | AI Config | **The Brain.** Custom configurations to align AI coding assistants with my specific architectural patterns and requirements. |
| [**Do-It.nvim**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/Do-It.nvim) | Neovim | **The Manager.** My daily driver for project management. I don't leave the terminal to track tasks; this handles it. |
| [**giant-ai**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai) | Python | **The Framework.** An open framework I built to integrate AI tools directly into my backend stack. |

### Neovim & Terminal Ecosystem

I live in the terminal (Tmux + Neovim). Beyond the workflow scripts above, I maintain several plugins to fill gaps in the ecosystem.

| Plugin | Language | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**giant-ai.nvim**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai.nvim) | Lua | Native Neovim integration for the giant-ai framework. |
| [**mark9.nvim**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/mark9.nvim) | Lua | Minimal, fast file navigation (Harpoon-style) without the bloat. |
| [**dap-logger**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/dap-logger) | Lua | Debugging context logger to capture state without pausing execution. |

### Architecture & Tech

**Core Stack**
Python, Node, Lua, Go, Rust, Bash

**Infrastructure**
Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Snowflake, Kubernetes, GCP
