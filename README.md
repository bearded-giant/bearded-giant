### About Me

25+ years building backend systems. I work across distributed processes, API platform architecture, security and auth systems, and analytical platforms — from design through execution. I like solving hard infrastructure problems and I build a lot of my own tools.

### What I Work On

**Platform Architecture & Distributed Systems**
Backend architecture and design for subscription commerce at scale — distributed processing, payment systems, real-time analytics, and multi-tenant e-commerce infrastructure.

**API & Security Platforms**
Authentication and authorization architecture, API gateway design, and platform-level security systems.

**Analytical Systems**
Large-scale data pipelines, real-time merchant analytics, and cross-sell/upsell product systems.

**AI Tooling**
Building [giant-ai](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai) — an open framework for AI tools, with a companion [Neovim plugin](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai.nvim).

**Neovim Ecosystem**
I build and maintain several Neovim plugins:
[Do-It.nvim](https://github.com/bearded-giant/Do-It.nvim) · [mark9.nvim](https://github.com/bearded-giant/mark9.nvim) · [dap-logger](https://github.com/bearded-giant/dap-logger)

**Developer Productivity**
CLI tools, proxies, and workflow automation — [Giant-Proxy](https://github.com/bearded-giant/Giant-Proxy) and various shell/Python utilities.
