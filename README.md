Based in Philadelphia, PA

### The Philosophy

I have been building backend systems for 25+ years. My professional work (Distributed Systems, Auth, Scale) happens in private repositories.

My public GitHub is more akin to my workbench. It is where I build the tooling, frameworks, and automation that allow me to manage that complexity. My personal focus is on **Developer Experience**: if a workflow has friction, I script it away.  I never want to repeat myself for daily actions...I'm lazy in a good way I guess.

### The Workflows

These are the repositories that actually power my day-to-day. They aren't polished products...they are the raw tools I use to handle many projects and initiatives in my day-to-day.  These I use every.single.day.

| Repo | Category | The Role it Plays |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**giant-tooling**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-tooling) | Automation | Git worktree lifecycle management, my personal workspace/scratch directory isolation, and full-text archive search. The system that keeps multi-branch, multi-project development fast and organized. |
| [**claude-code-config**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/claude-code-config) | AI Config | My personal custom configurations to align Claude code with my specific architectural patterns and requirements. I read and write a lot of docs, and this is how I do it. |
| [**Do-It.nvim**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/Do-It.nvim) | Neovim | My daily driver for todos, notes, even seeing my calendar. I don't leave the terminal to track tasks it's all here. |
| [**giant-ai**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai) | Python | An open framework I built to integrate AI tools directly into my backend stack. Was more of a proof that you didn't need to pay for Cursor.  It's there if you are curious. |
| [**mdlive**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/mdlive) | Rust | Live markdown viewer and workspace organizer (of sorts) that can be used to read and organize your md files (user created or AI). Point it at a file or directory, get instant rendered preview in the browser. |

### Neovim & Terminal Ecosystem

I live in the terminal (Tmux + Neovim). Beyond the workflow scripts above, I maintain several plugins to fill gaps in the ecosystem.

| Plugin | Language | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**giant-ai.nvim**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai.nvim) | Lua | Native Neovim integration for the giant-ai framework |
| [**mark9.nvim**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/mark9.nvim) | Lua | Minimal, fast file marking like `marks` and coupled with `Harpoon`-like searching |
| [**dap-logger**](https://github.com/bearded-giant/dap-logger) | Lua | Debugging context logger to capture state without pausing execution |

### Architecture & Tech (Lately)

**Stacks**:`Bash`, `Python`, `Node`, `Lua`, `Golang`, `Rust`

**Infra**: `Nginx`, `Postgres`, `Redis`, `Elasticsearch`, `Snowflake`, `Kubernetes`, `GCP`
